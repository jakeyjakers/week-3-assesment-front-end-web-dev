			<h3>About me</h3>

            <div id="main">
                <p>
                    I've grown up in utah my whole life so I guess you could say I'm native.
                    A qucik story bout me. Born and raised in Utah. My farthest school was my high school
                    at maybe a mile away. Worked at Scofield scout camp as a teen, best job I ever had so far.
                    Did HVAC for a decade as an adult. Mother passed when I was 16, and my father when I was 26. 
                    Leaving me and my sister(mostly me) to care for an autistic brother. Met my wife soon there after and am now 
                    happily married. Hopefully soon we'll add to our family.
                </p>

                    Not in any specific order

                    <li>Board Games
                        <p>I love these because it gives good social interaction while making you strategize and do your best.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>Aquariums
                        I've always loved Fish. It's relaxing to set one up and add and change it to grow into an amazing ecosystem.
                    </li>

                    <li>Camping
                        <p>Really i need to explain this? Camping is just super fun.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>Shoting
                        <p>I did competition shooting for several years. I find it fun and relaxing because I am just competing with myself to become better.</p>
